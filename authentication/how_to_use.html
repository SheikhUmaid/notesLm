        <h1>NotesLM</h1>
        <p>Learning made simple, structured, and always available.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Intro -->
      <h2>Welcome to NotesLM</h2>
      <p>
        NotesLM is a simple, structured, and focused space where you can log in,
        enter your chat name, create your own notebooks, upload your study files,
        and ask as many questions as you want about your content. Everything is
        centered around one idea: keep your learning flow smooth and your notes
        always accessible.
      </p>
      <p>
        On this page, we’ll walk through the experience in detail. Even though the
        idea is brief and clear — <strong>login to NotesLM, enter your chat name, create a notebook, upload files, and ask questions</strong> —
        we’re going to explain every step in a calm, long, and descriptive way so
        you always know exactly what to expect from the platform.
      </p>

      <div class="highlight">
        In short: you log in, choose your chat name so NotesLM knows how to talk to
        you, create a notebook for your subject or topic, upload your files like
        PDFs, notes, and slides, and then simply start asking questions. NotesLM
        stays with you while you learn.
      </div>

      <hr class="section-divider" />

      <!-- Section: Login -->
      <h2>Step 1: Login to NotesLM</h2>
      <p>
        The very first thing you do is <strong>log in to NotesLM</strong>. This is your
        entry point, your front door to everything that will follow. When you arrive
        at the login page, you are greeted with the NotesLM branding and a simple
        form that invites you to sign in to your learning space.
      </p>
      <p>
        Logging in is how NotesLM connects you with your personal notebooks, your
        uploaded files, and your previous question history. Once you are logged in,
        everything on the platform becomes personalized around your learning
        journey. You are no longer just a visitor — you become a learner with a
        defined workspace.
      </p>
      <p>
        The login flow is intentionally straightforward. You see fields for your
        username and password, and once you enter your details and click the button
        to continue, NotesLM prepares your environment. You don’t have to think
        about the internal systems or any complicated process. You just know that
        after logging in, your dashboard, your notebooks, your uploaded materials,
        and your chat interactions will all be ready for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        As soon as you log in successfully, NotesLM treats you as an individual
        learner with your own preferences, your own topics, and your own pace. You
        are now ready for the next important step: telling NotesLM who you are in
        the chat.
      </p>

      <!-- Section: Chat Name -->
      <h2>Step 2: Enter Your Chat Name</h2>
      <p>
        After logging in, NotesLM encourages you to <strong>enter your chat name</strong>.
        Your chat name is how you want to be addressed when you interact with the
        system. It’s a simple thing, but it makes the experience feel more
        personalized and more human.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might choose your real name, a nickname, or a study alias that you
        like. Once you enter this chat name, NotesLM can refer to you directly
        during your sessions, making every response feel like it’s written to you
        and not just to any generic user. This name also helps when you create
        notebooks or when your interactions are saved; it anchors everything
        around your identity as a learner.
      </p>
      <p>
        The chat name also helps keep different profiles clear in your mind. If
        you want to use NotesLM differently for school, university, or personal
        projects, you can choose a chat name that matches your context. No matter
        how you use it, the main idea is simple: you log in and then you tell
        NotesLM, “This is how you should talk to me.”
      </p>

      <div class="highlight">
        Think of your chat name as your learning identity inside NotesLM.
        Every notebook, uploaded file, and conversation is tied back to this
        identity so your learning stays organized.
      </div>

      <!-- Section: Create Notebook -->
      <h2>Step 3: Create a Notebook for Your Learning</h2>
      <p>
        Once you have logged in and set your chat name, NotesLM invites you to
        <strong>create your first notebook</strong>. A notebook in NotesLM is like a
        dedicated space for a specific subject, topic, or project. Instead of mixing
        everything together, you can separate your learning areas cleanly.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, you might create one notebook called <em>“Data Structures”</em>,
        another one called <em>“Operating Systems”</em>, another for
        <em>“Machine Learning Basics”</em>, or anything else you are currently studying.
        Each notebook becomes a hub where your files, your questions, and your
        answers all live together in a structured way.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you create a notebook, you typically give it a name that describes the
        topic you care about and sometimes a short description so that future you
        immediately remembers what this notebook is about. Over time, as you add
        more notebooks, this structure keeps your NotesLM space neat and easy to
        navigate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside each notebook, you can add more content, ask focused questions, and
        treat it as a dedicated environment for one area of study. By separating
        things into notebooks like this, you avoid clutter and stay mentally
        organized, which matters a lot when you are learning multiple things in
        parallel.
      </p>

      <!-- Section: Upload Files -->
      <h2>Step 4: Upload Your Files into NotesLM</h2>
      <p>
        After you create a notebook, the next natural step is to
        <strong>upload your files</strong>. NotesLM is built so that you do not have to
        switch between different apps, scattered folders, and random documents. You
        bring your files directly into NotesLM and keep them close to your
        conversations and questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        These files could be lecture slides, PDF notes, assignment instructions,
        reference books, project documents, or even images that contain important
        information. When you upload them into a notebook that you have created,
        NotesLM understands that these files belong to that specific learning area.
      </p>
      <p>
        The upload process is simple. You choose the notebook, click on the upload
        area, select your files from your device, and let NotesLM attach them to
        your space. Once uploaded, the files become available whenever you need
        to refer back to them, and they can also act as a base for the questions
        you ask later.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea is that instead of thinking, “Where did I keep that PDF?” you
        simply think, “I uploaded that PDF into my NotesLM notebook, so I know
        exactly where it is.” Over time, this reduces friction every time you
        switch back to studying.
      </p>

      <div class="highlight">
        Login → choose your chat name → create a notebook → upload your files.
        Once these steps are done, you are fully set up and can start asking
        questions confidently.
      </div>

      <!-- Section: Ask Questions -->
      <h2>Step 5: Ask Questions About Your Notes and Files</h2>
      <p>
        With your notebook created and your files uploaded, you now reach one of
        the most important parts of NotesLM: <strong>asking questions</strong>. This is
        where the platform turns into a true learning partner. You don’t just
        keep your files in one place; you actually interact with them through
        your questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might have doubts about a specific topic in your notes, or you might
        want a summary of a long PDF, or you may be trying to understand what a
        particular concept means in simple terms. NotesLM lets you ask those
        questions naturally, in your own words, using the chat interface that
        addresses you by your chosen chat name.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, after logging in and opening your “Data Structures” notebook,
        you might say something like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="inline-label">Question:</span> “Can you explain the
          difference between a stack and a queue using simple examples?”</li>
        <li><span class="inline-label">Question:</span> “Summarize chapter 3 of
          this PDF I uploaded and highlight the main formulas.”</li>
        <li><span class="inline-label">Question:</span> “Give me some practice
          questions based on these notes for revision.”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        NotesLM responds within the context of your notebook and the files you
        have uploaded. You don’t need to manually reference everything every
        time. Instead, your conversation stays grounded in your chosen topic,
        your uploaded content, and your chat identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pattern stays simple but powerful: you log in, you have your chat
        name, you select or create a notebook, your files are already there, and
        you keep asking questions whenever something is unclear or whenever you
        want to deepen your understanding. The platform becomes a quiet companion
        that stays focused on what you are working on.
      </p>

      <hr class="section-divider" />

      <!-- Section: Continuous Use -->
      <h2>Using NotesLM Regularly</h2>
      <p>
        The more you use NotesLM, the more natural this flow becomes. Every
        session starts in roughly the same way: you log in, NotesLM recognizes
        you, you see your notebooks, and you decide where you want to focus. Over
        time, your notebooks fill up with files, questions, and answers that
        represent your unique learning path.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might start your day by logging in and opening your main notebook
        for that day’s study plan. You might upload a new set of lecture slides
        or an assignment sheet your teacher shared. Then you ask a few questions
        to make sure you fully understand the material. Later, you come back and
        review the answers, ask follow-up questions, or create new notebooks for
        future subjects.
      </p>
      <p>
        This repeating rhythm — <strong>login → chat name → notebook → upload →
        questions</strong> — becomes the backbone of how you interact with NotesLM. It
        is not complicated; it is intentionally repetitive so that you never
        waste energy trying to remember how to use the platform. Instead, all of
        your mental energy goes into the actual learning itself.
      </p>

      <!-- Section: Summary -->
      <h2>Quick Summary of the Flow</h2>
      <p>
        Even though this page describes the flow in a very detailed and extended
        way, the core idea behind NotesLM is actually brief and simple:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You <strong>login to NotesLM</strong> using your account.</li>
        <li>You <strong>enter your chat name</strong> so the system can address you personally.</li>
        <li>You <strong>create a notebook</strong> for each subject or project you care about.</li>
        <li>You <strong>upload your files</strong>—PDFs, slides, notes, and more—into those notebooks.</li>
        <li>You <strong>ask questions</strong> about your notes, your files, and your topics, and you use the answers to learn better.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These few steps repeat every time you use the platform, and they form
        the foundation of your learning environment. All the detailed explanation
        on this page simply exists to make sure each small piece is clear in your
        mind and that you always know exactly why you are doing what you are
        doing when you interact with NotesLM.
      </p>

      <div class="highlight">
        Whenever you think about NotesLM, remember this simple sentence:
        <strong>Login to NotesLM, enter your chat name, create a notebook, upload your files, and ask questions as you learn.</strong>
